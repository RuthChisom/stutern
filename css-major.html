<ol>
          <li>HTML<b>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</b> is the standard markup
          language for displaying documents in a web browser. It is yhe basic structure of a webpage.</li>


          <li>CSS<b>(Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is used to describe
          <i>styles</i> for displaying documents written in
        the markup language <em>i.e HTML, or XML</em>.</li>


 <li>You can use the <i>inline</i>, <i>internal</i> or <i>external </i> method of styling</li>


<li>CSS is very important in organizing your webpage. Without it, everything might seem too scattered or clumsy</li>
</ol>

          <b>Padding:</b> This is the space between an element's border and the
          content inside it. <i>padding</i> property controls the
          space inside an element.
        </p>


        <p>
          <b>Margin:</b> This is the space around an element's border.
          <i>Margin</i> property controls the space outside an element.
        </p>


        <p>
          <b>Border:</b> This is the edge/wall of an element. 
The <i>border</i> property allows you to specify
          the style, width, and color of an element's border.
